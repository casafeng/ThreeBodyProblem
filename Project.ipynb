    "### General properties of solutions of ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions of the ODEs describing the general three-body problem can be represented by curves in 3D. In a special case, a solution can be a single point known also as a fixed point or as an equilibrium solution; a trajectory can either reach the fixed point or approach it asymptotically. Typically, periodic orbits are centered around the fixed points, which are called stable points or stable centers. Moreover, if a trajectory spirals toward a fixed point or moves away from it, the point is called a spiral \\textit{sink} or spiral \\textit{source}, respectively. There can also be a \\textit{saddle point} in which two trajectories approach the point and two leave it, but all other trajectories are kept away from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a mathematical point of view, it is required that solutions to ODEs exist and that they are unique. The existence can be either global when a solution is defined for any time in the past, present and future, or local when it is defined only for a short period of time. The uniqueness of solution means that there is only one solution at each point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For given ODEs, the existence and uniqueness are typically stated by mathematical theorems. Let us consider the following first-order ODE\n",
    "$ y'(x) = f(y(x), x),$\n",
    "where $y' = dy/dx$, and the initial condition is $y(x_{0}) = y_{0}$, with $x_{0}$ being the initial value of $x \\in [x_{0}-\\varepsilon, x_{0}+\\varepsilon]$. Picard’s (or Lipschitz and Cauchy’s) existence theorem states that if $f(y(x), x)$ is a Lipschitz continuous function in $y$ and $x$, then there is $\\varepsilon > 0$ such that a unique solution $y(x)$ exists on the interval $[x_{0}-\\varepsilon, x_{0}+\\varepsilon]$.\n",

    "Despite governed by simple Newtonian mechanics, the three-body problem exhibits extraordinary dynamical complexity. Unlike the two-body problem, which has an exact analytical solution, the three-body problem cannot be solved analytically in the general case because the equations of motion are nonlinear and strongly coupled, leading to chaotic behavior. This chaotic behaviour is due to the fact that tiny variations in initial positions or velocities can cause large divergences in trajectories over time. Therefore simulation is necessary to understand the behaviour that under a deterministic system actually seems unpredictable and stochastic."
