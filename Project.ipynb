    "### Basic formulation\n",
    "In the general three-body problem, three bodies of arbitrary masses move in a three-dimensional (3D) space under their mutual gravitational interactions. However, if the motions of the bodies are confined to one plane, the problem is called the $\\textit{planar}$ general three-body problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this paper, we use Newton’s theory of gravity to describe the gravitational interactions between the three bodies; the only exception is Section~9, in which we discuss the relativistic three-body problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully solve the general three-body problem, it is required for the past and future motions of the bodies to be uniquely determined by their present positions and velocities. Let the three masses be denoted by $M_i$, where $i = 1,2,3$, and their positions with respect to the origin of an inertial Cartesian coordinate system by the vectors $\\vec{R}_i$. Define the position of one body with respect to another by\n",

Since these equations can be converted into sets of two first-order ODEs, there are actually eighteen first-order ODEs required to fully describe the general three-body problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard mathematical procedure allows solving such ODEs by quadratures if independent integrals of motion exist. Therefore, we now determine the number of integrals of motion for the general three-body problem."

    "The standard formulation of the general three-body problem presented in the previous section is often replaced by either the Hamiltonian formulation extensively used by Poincaré (1892), or by the variational formulation described in detail and used by Siegel and Moser (1991). Here, we present only the Hamiltonian formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the so-called natural units and introduce $G = 1$ in Eqs.~(1) and (8). Moreover, we write $\\vec{R}_{i} = (R_{1i}, R_{2i}, R_{3i}) \\equiv q_{ki}$, where $R_{1i}, R_{2i}, R_{3i}$ are components of the vector $\\vec{R}_i$ in the inertial Cartesian coordinate system, and $k = 1, 2, 3$. Using this notation, we define the momentum $p_{ki}$ as\n",

    "The governing equations describing this problem are derived by Szebehely (1967) and Simó and Stuchi (2000), who also discussed their applications to the Sun–Earth–Moon problem, known as the Hill lunar theory. In this paper, we limit our discussion of the Hill problem to its circular and elliptic versions of the restricted three-body problem, and describe them in Section~6.5 and 7.3, respectively.\n"

    "### General properties of solutions of ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions of the ODEs describing the general three-body problem can be represented by curves in 3D. In a special case, a solution can be a single point known also as a \\textit{fixed point} or as an \\textit{equilibrium solution}; a trajectory can either reach the fixed point or approach it asymptotically. Typically, periodic orbits are centered around the fixed points, which are called stable points or stable centers. Moreover, if a trajectory spirals toward a fixed point or moves away from it, the point is called a spiral \\textit{sink} or spiral \\textit{source}, respectively. There can also be a \\textit{saddle point} in which two trajectories approach the point and two leave it, but all other trajectories are kept away from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a mathematical point of view, it is required that solutions to ODEs exist and that they are unique. The existence can be either global when a solution is defined for any time in the past, present and future, or local when it is defined only for a short period of time. The uniqueness of solution means that there is only one solution at each point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For given ODEs, the existence and uniqueness are typically stated by mathematical theorems. Let us consider the following first-order ODE\n",
    "$ y'(x) = f(y(x), x),$\n",
    "where $y' = dy/dx$, and the initial condition is $y(x_{0}) = y_{0}$, with $x_{0}$ being the initial value of $x \\in [x_{0}-\\varepsilon, x_{0}+\\varepsilon]$. Picard’s (or Lipschitz and Cauchy’s) existence theorem states that if $f(y(x), x)$ is a Lipschitz continuous function in $y$ and $x$, then there is $\\varepsilon > 0$ such that a unique solution $y(x)$ exists on the interval $[x_{0}-\\varepsilon, x_{0}+\\varepsilon]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another requirement is that the problem is well-defined, which means that a solution must be continuous with respect to the initial data. Being aware of the above mathematical requirements, Poincaré studied the problem of solving ODEs from another perspective by developing qualitative methods, which he described in the third volume of his book (Poincaré, 1892); Poincaré’s work was done mainly for the CR3BP, and we describe it in Section~6.\n",
